# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ahaslides-product/design`, **newest first**.

**The rule:** every merge adds one entry here **and** bumps `version` in `package.json`.
The top entry's version MUST equal `package.json` → `version` — `standards.mjs` enforces it, so a
PR that forgets either goes red. The `v<version>` release tag (what `npm publish` ships) matches too.
The gate also rejects an unfilled `(#PR)` placeholder in the top entry: link the **real** PR number.

**Format** — one entry per version:

```
## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD
### Added        ← new component / prop / token / export
### Changed      ← behaviour or API change to something that already shipped
### Fixed        ← bug / gate / doc fix, no API change
### Removed       ← a removed export / component / token
- one short bullet per change, written for a consumer; link the real PR: (#123) — never a bare (#PR)
```

Include only the sections you touched. **Versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org)** — pre-1.0:
an additive change (new component/prop/token) bumps **MINOR** (`0.x.0`); a fix with no API change
bumps **PATCH** (`0.0.x`); a breaking change also bumps MINOR until 1.0, and is called out in the bullet.

## 0.40.0 — 2026-09-11
### Added
- **Settings list — `visible_if` conditional visibility (the Shopify model).** A schema row can declare a trigger: it is shown ONLY when its trigger setting is on and hidden when off, updating live as the trigger changes. Structured form `visibleIf: { key, equals?, in?, not? }` or the Shopify string `visible_if: "{{ settings.<key> }}"` / `"{{ settings.mode == 'advanced' }}"`. A dependent row renders NESTED — indented 24, bound tighter to its parent, de-emphasised label — and when hidden is `display:none` so it leaves no phantom gap (SETTINGS-07/14/19). (#80)

## 0.39.1 — 2026-09-11
### Changed
- **Settings — setting label weight.** A member setting's label is now regular (400), not semibold — only the group/section header (`aha-section-header` / `aha-setting-group` / `settings-list` group header) carries weight (600). Restores the header-vs-member hierarchy (SETTINGS-37) on `aha-setting-row` and `<aha-settings-list>` rows. (#79)
